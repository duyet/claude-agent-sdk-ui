"""API key authentication middleware.

Security considerations:
- API keys are ONLY accepted via the X-API-Key header, never query parameters.
  Query strings are logged in server access logs, browser history, proxy logs,
  and referrer headers, which exposes credentials to unauthorized parties.
- Timing-safe comparison prevents timing attacks that could leak key information
  by measuring response times with different key prefixes.
- Failed authentication attempts are logged with client IP and path for security
  monitoring and incident response, but the provided key is NEVER logged.
