"""Permission hooks for controlling agent tool access.

This module provides pre-tool-use hooks for restricting file operations and
bash commands to specific directories, enhancing security when using the
Claude Agent SDK.

The hooks implement a whitelist-based security model where:
- Read operations are always allowed (safe, read-only)
- Write/Edit operations are restricted to allowed directories
- Bash commands can be filtered by command patterns
- Bash file redirections can be controlled

Typical usage:
    from agent.core.hook import create_permission_hook
    from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions

    hook = create_permission_hook(
        allowed_directories=["/path/to/project", "/tmp"]
    )

    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        hooks={'PreToolUse': [hook]}
    )

    """Create a pre-tool-use hook for controlling agent permissions.

    This function creates a hook that intercepts tool calls before execution
    and applies security restrictions. The hook is designed to be composable
    with other hooks in the Claude Agent SDK.

    Security Model:
        - Whitelist: Only directories in allowed_directories permit writes
        - Read-only: Read tool is always permitted (safe operation)
        - Command filtering: Specific bash command patterns can be blocked
        - Redirection control: Bash > and >> operators can be restricted

    Args:
        allowed_directories: List of absolute directory paths where file
            operations (Write, Edit) are permitted. Paths are matched using
            startswith(), so "/home/user/project" allows writes to any file
            under that directory tree.
            Defaults to [PROJECT_ROOT, "/tmp"] for convenience.

        block_bash_commands: List of bash command prefixes to block.
            Each string is matched against the beginning of command tokens.
            For example, "rm " blocks "rm file.txt" but not "rm" as a
            standalone word in a larger command.
            Defaults to ["rm ", "mv ", "cp ", "mkdir ", "rmdir ", "touch "].

        allow_bash_redirection: Controls bash output redirection (>, >>).
            When False (default), redirections are only allowed to:
            - /dev/null, /dev/zero, etc. (device files)
            - Files within allowed_directories
            When True, all redirections are permitted.

    Returns:
        HookMatcher: A configured hook matcher for PreToolUse events that
        can be passed to ClaudeAgentOptions.

    Example - Basic usage with project directory:
        ```python
        from agent.core.hook import create_permission_hook

        hook = create_permission_hook(
            allowed_directories=["/home/user/myproject", "/tmp"]
        )
        ```

    Example - Custom command blocking:
        ```python
        hook = create_permission_hook(
            allowed_directories=["/safe/dir"],
            block_bash_commands=["rm ", "mv ", "dd ", "mkfs "]
        )
        ```

    Example - Allow bash redirection:
        ```python
        hook = create_permission_hook(
            allowed_directories=["/workspace"],
            allow_bash_redirection=True
        )
        ```

    Note:
        When using create_enhanced_options(with_permissions=True), this hook
        is automatically configured with sensible defaults based on the
        project root directory.

Permission Hooks Module
=======================

This module provides hooks for controlling agent tool access, implementing
a whitelist-based security model for file and command operations.

Available Hooks
---------------

1. create_permission_hook()
   Configurable permission hook with fine-grained control:
   - allowed_directories: List of paths where writes are permitted
   - block_bash_commands: List of command prefixes to block
   - allow_bash_redirection: Control > and >> operators

2. create_sandbox_hook()
   Convenience function for strict sandbox environments:
   - Single primary sandbox directory
   - Blocks additional commands (wget, curl)
   - No bash redirection outside sandbox

Usage Examples
--------------

Example 1: Restrict to project and temp directories
    from agent.core.hook import create_permission_hook
    from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions

    hook = create_permission_hook(
        allowed_directories=["/path/to/project", "/tmp"]
    )

    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        hooks={'PreToolUse': [hook]}
    )

Example 2: Strict sandbox mode
    from agent.core.hook import create_sandbox_hook

    hook = create_sandbox_hook(
        sandbox_dir="/path/to/sandbox",
        additional_allowed_dirs=["/tmp"]
    )

Example 3: Custom bash command blocking
    hook = create_permission_hook(
        allowed_directories=["/safe/dir"],
        block_bash_commands=["rm ", "mv ", "dd ", "mkfs "]
    )

Security Features
-----------------
- Blocks Write/Edit outside allowed directories
- Blocks configurable bash commands (rm, mv, cp, mkdir, touch by default)
- Blocks bash redirection to files outside allowed directories
- Always allows Read operations (safe, read-only access)
- Allows safe bash commands (ls, cat, grep, echo, pwd, cd, etc.)

Default Blocked Commands
------------------------
- rm: Remove files/directories
- mv: Move/rename files
- cp: Copy files
- mkdir: Create directories
- rmdir: Remove directories
- touch: Create/modify file timestamps

Additional Sandbox Blocked Commands
-----------------------------------
- wget: Download files from web
- curl: Transfer data (can write files)
